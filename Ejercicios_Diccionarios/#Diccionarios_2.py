#Diccionarios_2

#Create a program who is able to create a dictionary using 2 lists of thr same size. 
#first one for keys and another one for values.

#Lists of data
keys_list = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'age']
values_list = ['Esteban', 'Lopez', '23']

dictionary = dict(zip(keys_list, values_list))
print(dictionary)

# I did some researche and found out the "dict" and "zip" functions, seems like it's working properly, but let me know if I have to either fix or implement something different.
